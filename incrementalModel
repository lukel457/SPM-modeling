In an Incremental Model, the finer details are ignored, and preset sections of the project will be planned out based on functionality. In each phase, the program takes on a new high-level functionality that the last level did not possess. The number of incremental phases can be determined using the specs.

CURSE will need the following things addressed over the prject timeline:
  1. Database of users (100 students, 10 faculty, 1 admin)
  2. Database of courses (CRN, course names, times, instructors)
  3. Three types of users (student – can register, can see available courses and their own schedule;
      instructor – can see available courses and their own course roster; admin – can see everything,
      can edit courses/users/schedules)
  4. Should include: multiple semesters, print-out of schedule, scheduling preferences
  
  These specs can be broken down into 4 main parts; the databases, the user type structure, the menu and basic functionality, and the extra functions for more complex work. These define the 4 versions of the project to follow.
  
  Version 1: A very basic system would be created first that will make student objects and allow them to sign up for classes.
  
  Version 2: Different classes will be made using inheritance to allow different permissions.
  
  Version 3: Scheduling process including error checks, priority, and preference options. 
  
  Version 4: Things that need to be added in this version would be print out of schedules, preferences, and any other requirements not addressed by this point
